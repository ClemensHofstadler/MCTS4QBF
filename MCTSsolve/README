This is a tool for solving QBFs using Monte Carlo tree search in combination with the QBF solver DepQBF.

BUILD:

Just call make.

USAGE:

The syntax for MCTSsolve is the following:

	MCTSsolve <input.qdimacs> <output.qdimacs>

where <input.qdimacs> is the path to the input formula and <output.qdimacs> is the
path to an output file. The output path can also be omitted. In this case,
the partial assignment will be printed on the screen.
